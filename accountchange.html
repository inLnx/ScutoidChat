            <h1>Scutoid Account Coming Soon<h1>
                <p>Soon you will be able to maanage your account in one place</p>
                <br>
                <h2>What happens to legacy accounts(ScutoidChat Accounts)</h2>
                <p>due to this being a one man operation, there will not be any migration from servers <br>
                you will need to create a new account. Expect the Legacy Accounts to be shut down in late 2025.</p>
                <h2>But Why?</h2>
                <p>We are working on ScutoidOS and it is not very ethical to need <br>
                multiple accounts for multiple services.</p>
                </h2>When can I create an account</h2>
                <p>currently not sure, but we will NOT delete the legacy accounts before we make <br>
                the "2.0" Accounts.</p>
